### What is a Literature Review?


A literature review is a piece of scholarly writing which summarizes, compares, and evaluates a clearly defined group of sources (books, articles, or other sources).


* What counts as literature?
* What makes it scholarly?
* How is it different from a book review?
* How is it different from a research paper?



### Why Should I Write a Literature Review?


* The purpose of a lit review is to contextualize, summarize, and, most importantly, evaluate a clearly demarcated body of scholarly literature.

* Lit reviews can be used as an introduction to a larger research project, or they can stand alone.



### How Do I Write a Literature Review?
1. Identify a topic.

2. Define the scope of your literature review.

3. Gather the relevant literature.

4. Critically engage sources individually and as a whole.

5. Organize your notes and thoughts into an appropriate outline.

6. Write, revise, rewrite, and revise again.



### 1. Identify a topic.


* A good topic for a literature review will be a research problem of some kind.


* Choose a topic of interest to you and your desired audience.


* Make sure you have access to literature on your topic.



### 2. Define the scope of your literature review.


### Questions to consider:

* Are there well known debates or open questions related to your topic?


* Which methodological perspectives are best suited for your topic?


* What kinds of literature should you include?


* Are there date parameters to consider? 



### 3. Gather the relevant literature.


* Search relevant databases and library catalogs using key terms and parameters from your topic and scope.


* Follow citations forward and backward where appropriate.



### 4. Critically engage sources individually and as a whole.


### Guiding questions for each source:


* Who is the author? What is the author's perspective?


* What method is used? Historical? Sociological? Ethnographic?


* What is the author's thesis?


* How does the author support that thesis?


* Is the argument convincing?



### Guiding questions for the whole:


* Are there any patterns that emerge?


* Is there a trajectory (or trajectories) of how key problems are addressed?


* How does each source relate to the others?


* Are there identifiable schools of thought?



### 5. Organize your notes and thoughts into an appropriate outline


### Introduction
* Introduce the topic of the lit review and provide some context.

* Identify themes and trends in the literature.

* Define the scope and sequence of the lit review.


### Body
* Organize your discussion chronologically, methodologically, or thematically.

* Summarize each source only as much as is needed for your discussion.

* Discuss your sources according to the themes and trends you have identified in your introduction.


### Conclusion
* Summarize the major themes and trends in the literature.

* Articulate where research currently stands.

* Identify problems, questions, or areas open for research.



### 6. Write, revise, rewrite, and revise again.


#### Good writing is rewriting. 

Each time you rework a draft you will sharpen your understanding of the material. Your readers will be grateful.
