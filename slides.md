## Writing a Literature Review
Religion 10-05: Islam in the West



### What is a Literature Review?
A literature review is a piece of scholarly writing which summarizes, compares, and evaluates a clearly defined group of sources (books, articles, or other sources).  
* What counts as literature?
* What makes it scholarly?
* How is it different from a book review?
* How is it different from a research paper?



### Why Should I Write a Literature Review?
* The purpose of a lit review is to contextualize, summarize, and, most importantly, evaluate a clearly demarcated body of scholarly literature.

* Lit reviews can be used as an introduction to a larger research project, or they can stand alone.



### How Do I Write a Literature Review?
* **Prepare** for the lit review by carefully reading and taking notes on your sources.
* **Focus** your evaluation of each source.
* **Organize** and outline your lit review.

## Focus


The difficulties of French Muslims integrating into French society: to what extent are they a result of France’s refusal to accommodate the religious sensibilities of its Muslim citizens and to what extent are they a result of French Muslims’ refusal to accommodate themselves to French institutions and social and political culture?


The debates around the 2004 French law banning Muslim girls from wearing headscarves in public schools highlighted tensions over the integration of French Muslims. How should we understand those tensions and how did the situation develop over the following decade?
