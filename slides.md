### What is a Literature Review?
A literature review is a piece of scholarly writing which summarizes, compares, and evaluates a clearly defined group of sources (books, articles, or other sources).  
* What counts as literature?
* What makes it scholarly?
* How is it different from a book review?
* How is it different from a research paper?



### Why Should I Write a Literature Review?
* The purpose of a lit review is to contextualize, summarize, and, most importantly, evaluate a clearly demarcated body of scholarly literature.

* Lit reviews can be used as an introduction to a larger research project, or they can stand alone.



### How Do I Write a Literature Review?
1. **Prepare** for the lit review by carefully reading and taking notes on your sources.

2. **Focus** your evaluation of each source.

3. **Organize** and outline your lit review.



## 1. Prepare


### Your Sources
Bowen, John R. *Why the French Don't like Headscarves: Islam, the State, and Public Space*. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2007.

Gemie, Sharif. *French Muslims: New Voices in Contemporary France.* University of Wales Press, 2010.

Kelpel, Giles. *Terror in France: The Rise of Jihad in the West*. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2017.


### Guiding Questions
* Who is the author? What is the author's perspective?

* What method is used? Historical? Sociological? Ethnographic?

* What is the author's thesis?

* How does the author support that thesis?

* Is the argument convincing? 



## 2. Focus


**Possible focus question:**

The difficulties of French Muslims integrating into French society: to what extent are they a result of France’s refusal to accommodate the religious sensibilities of its Muslim citizens and to what extent are they a result of French Muslims’ refusal to accommodate themselves to French institutions and social and political culture?


**Possible focus question:**

The debates around the 2004 French law banning Muslim girls from wearing headscarves in public schools highlighted tensions over the integration of French Muslims. How should we understand those tensions and how did the situation develop over the following decade? 



## Organize


### Introduction
* Introduce the topic of the lit review and provide some context.

* Identify themes and trends in the literature.

* Define the scope and sequence of the lit review.


### Body
* Organize your discussion chronologically, methodologically, or thematically.

* Summarize each source only as much as is needed for your discussion.

* Discuss your sources according to the themes and trends you have identified in your introduction.


### Conclusion
* Summarize the major themes and trends in the literature.

* Articulate where research currently stands.

* Identify problems, questions, or areas open for research.
